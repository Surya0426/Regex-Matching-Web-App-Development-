 Regex-Matching-Web-App-Development-
Regular expression (RegEx) matching is a method of searching, finding, and manipulating text based on patterns. It allows you to define a pattern, or a set of rules, and then search within a text for instances that match that pattern. This is useful for tasks such as:

* Validating input,
* Searching for specific strings or patterns within a larger body of text,
* Extracting specific information from text data.
